# Tonal - UI Coding Challenge

This Metrics Bubble coding challenge can be completed with the toolchain of your choice. We included complete requirements for Flutter and web, but if you prefer to show off your skills in Swift (iOS), Kotlin (Android), or React Native please feel free to adapt this exercise by translating the requirements for that toolchain. You only need to complete this exercise once.

## Evaluation

Regardless of how you complete this exercise, we'll be focused on evaluating these areas:

- Code organization. The widget should be separated from the demo webpage. It should be easy to navigate the project.
- Code quality. The code should be understandable and commented when necessary. The widget should be written with the understanding that it will be used in many different places and require additional features in the future.
- Attention to detail. This widget was created by our design team, so they'll be concerned that their design is matched well in the final product. The product team will be concerned that the requirements are implemented as written.
